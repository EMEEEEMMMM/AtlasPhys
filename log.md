## TODO:
1. Add a slightly real light source
2. Optimize the loop since (now barely support for 20 cubes in python)
3. Maybe turn to taichi or numba someday


## DONE:
1. Refactored the whole collision detection system (Fixed: Fix when two cubes have the same x, z collide they will crush into each other and the top sink into the bottom utill they coincide)
